# Setup VSCode

1. Download and install [Copperspice](https://www.copperspice.com/docs/cs_overview/main-install.html)
2. Create a ``.vscode`` folder in your workspace
3. Copy everything from the ``vscode-settings`` folder into ``.vscode`` (Except for the ``README.md``). You might have to merge them manually if you already have some settings.
4. Change all instances of ``<COPPERSPICE PATH>`` to the location of CopperSpice. If you have CopperSpice already installed in a library path you can probably delete the settings that use this path.
